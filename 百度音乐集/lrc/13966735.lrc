[00:01.00]I can't afford
[00:02.00]to breath in this town
[00:04.00]Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
[00:09.00]Hooked back up to my cathode ray
[00:23.00][00:19.00][00:14.00]I'm better off dead
[00:37.00][00:32.00][00:28.00]Prove Yourself
[00:42.00]I wanna breath I wanna grow
[00:47.00]I'd say I want it but I don't know how
[00:50.00]I work,
[00:51.00]I bleed,
[00:52.00]I beg,
[00:54.00]I pray
[00:55.00]But I'm better off dead
[01:43.00][01:39.00][01:35.00][01:03.00][00:59.00]I'm better off dead
[01:59.00][01:55.00][01:51.00][01:47.00][01:16.00][01:12.00][01:08.00]Prove Yourself
[02:00.00]Why?
