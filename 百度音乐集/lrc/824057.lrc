[00:03.54]Here
[00:04.18]Pet Shop Boys
[00:10.04]Xiao Wu
[00:11.84]
[00:19.06]We all have a dream
[00:20.36]of a place we belong
[00:27.83]The fire is burning
[00:30.01]and the radio’s on
[00:36.77]Somebody smiles
[00:38.46]and it means 'I love you'
[00:43.42]but sometimes we don’t notice
[00:47.39]when the dream has come true
[00:51.26]
[00:56.72]You’ve got a home here
[01:03.71]Call it what you want
[01:05.06]You’ve got a home here
[01:12.36]to return to when you can’t
[01:18.85]face the world and you need
[01:23.26]some support to succeed
[01:32.16]You’ve got a home
[01:33.23]
[01:38.80]We all make a mess
[01:40.36]of our lives from time to time
[01:47.56]It’s part of the process
[01:50.27]that you stumble as you climb
[01:56.52]And if you ever feel
[01:58.67]the pain is far too big a deal
[02:03.09]I say with pride
[02:07.41]I’ll be on your side
[02:11.53]
[02:16.50]You’ve got a home here
[02:23.55]Call it what you want
[02:24.95]You’ve got a home here
[02:32.06]You’re gonna want it when you can’t
[02:38.68]face the world and you need
[02:43.06]some support to succeed
[02:51.96]You’ve got a home
[03:00.90]You’ve got a home
[03:06.71]End
