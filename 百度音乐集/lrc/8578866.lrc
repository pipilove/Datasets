[00:09.00]《August Rush》
[00:11.50]
[00:12.12]Sometimes the world
[00:12.87]tries to knock it out of you
[00:14.59]
[00:18.50]But I believe in music
[00:20.39]the way that some people
[00:21.27]believe in fairy tales.
[00:22.96]
[00:37.20]I like to imagine that what I hear
[00:40.10]came from my mother and father.
[00:42.50]
[00:58.11]Maybe the notes I hear...
[01:00.30]are the same ones they heard
[01:03.10]the night they met.
[01:04.50]
[01:06.60]Maybe that's how they found each other.
[01:08.83]
[01:12.60]Maybe that's how they'll find me.
[01:14.80]
[01:44.50]I believe that, once upon a time
[01:47.50]long ago
[01:50.65]they heard the music and followed it.
