[00:01.88]               Amanda Stott
[00:03.32]
[00:12.16]Can't find the words
[00:18.63]Can't find the sounds
[00:25.30]These streets run wild, my stars are crossed
[00:31.75]The dreams you want most are the ones that get lost
[00:38.88]Can't find my pride
[00:45.17]Where did it go
[00:51.51]I close my eyes the room goes round
[00:57.89]In a river of tears falling down on the ground
[01:04.73]Every time I walk away
[01:07.98]Something you say always pulls me back
[01:12.10]And I see my whole life right before my eyes
[01:17.82]Every time I try to break away baby it's no lie
[01:25.69]When I look into your eyes
[01:30.32]I just want to cry
[01:44.11]You pull me close but you're miles away
[01:57.13]Without your love my heart gets cold
[02:03.83]The things I held near were the things that you stole
[02:10.36]Every time I walk away
[02:13.23]Something you say always pulls me back
[02:17.95]And I see my whole life right before my eyes
[02:23.81]Every time I try to break away baby it's no lie
[02:31.23]When I look into your eyes
[02:36.11]I just want to cry
[02:40.14]Every time I think about it I cry
[02:46.42]Everyday I live without it, every time
[02:53.17]Every time I walk away
[02:56.71]Something you say always pulls me back
[03:00.61]And I see my whole life right before my eyes
[03:06.19]Every time I try to break away baby it's no lie
[03:13.92]When I look into your eyes
[03:18.92]I just want to cry
[03:26.65]I just want to cry
[03:32.03]I just want to cry
