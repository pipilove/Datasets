[00:06.57]
[00:15.70]When minutes become hours
[00:19.84]When days become years
[00:24.57]And I don't know where you are
[00:28.16]Color seems so dull without you
[00:33.86]Have we lost our minds?
[00:38.41]What have we done?
[00:42.16]But it all doesn't seem to matter
[00:46.81]anymore
[00:51.32]When you kissed me on that street,
[00:54.17]I kissed you back
[00:56.50]You held me in your arms,
[00:58.45]I held you in mine
[01:00.81]You picked me up
[01:03.16]to lay me down
[01:05.00]When I look into your eyes
[01:07.60]I can hear you cry for a bit more of you
[01:13.06]and I'm drenched in your love
[01:18.93]I'm no longer able to hold it back
[01:24.85]
[01:37.30]Is it too late to ask for love?
[01:41.56]Is it wrong to feel right?
[01:46.10]When the world is winding down
[01:49.91]Thoughts of you linger around
[01:55.51]Have we lost our minds?
[01:59.99]What have we done?
[02:03.98]But it all doesn’t seem to matter
[02:08.42]anymore Ahaah...
[02:13.28]When you kissed me on that street,
[02:16.03]I kissed you back
[02:18.04]You held me in your arms,
[02:20.30]I held you in mine
[02:22.47]You picked me up
[02:24.69]to lay me down
[02:26.59]When I look into your eyes
[02:29.10]I can hear you cry
[02:31.25]for a little bit more of you and I
[02:36.05]I'm drenched in your love
[02:40.43]I’m no longer able to
[02:44.22]hold it back
[02:53.88]
[02:58.03]When you
[02:59.72]kissed me on that street,
[03:01.71]I kissed you back
[03:03.74]You held me in your arms,
[03:06.17]I held you in mine
[03:08.32]You picked me up
[03:10.10]to lay me down
[03:12.36]When I look into your eyes
[03:15.03]I can hear you cry
[03:17.18]for a little bit more of you and I
[03:21.99]I'm drenched in your love
[03:26.29]I'm no longer able to
[03:30.12]hold it back
[03:33.11]
