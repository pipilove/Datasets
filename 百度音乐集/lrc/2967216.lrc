[04:38.95][00:01.28]Square One
[00:10.64]
[00:15.76]You're in control is there anywhere you wanna go?
[00:21.86]You're in control is there anything you wanna know?
[00:29.37]The future's for discovering
[00:35.41]The space in which we're travelling
[00:43.89]
[01:00.00]From the top of the first page
[01:04.48]To the end of the last page
[01:12.63]From the start in your own way
[01:19.30]You just want somebody listening to what you say
[01:27.00]It doesn't matter who you are.
[01:37.17]
[01:45.17]Under the surface trying to break through
[01:49.25]Deciphering the coins in you
[01:56.85]I need a coin thats virtually in black
[02:04.23]I'm on the top I can't get back
[02:18.67]Whoah. Woah.
[02:23.19]
[02:28.39]From the first line of the first page
[02:33.55]To the end of the last page
[02:40.17]You were looking
[02:43.96]From the start in your own way
[02:47.67]You just want somebody listening to what you say
[02:55.78]It doesn't matter who you are
[03:04.29]It doesn't matter who you are
[03:13.36]
[03:20.20]Oooh.
[03:27.09]You just want somebody listening to what you say
[03:35.12]You just want somebody listening to what you say
[03:42.38]It doesn't matter who you are
[03:46.89]It doesn't matter who you are
[03:56.51]
[04:06.15]Is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely too
[04:14.43]Bleeding all your colours into one
[04:19.31]And if you come undone as if you'd been run through
[04:25.46]Some catapult it fired you
[04:28.98]You wonder if your chance will ever come
[04:34.48]And if you're stuck in square one.
