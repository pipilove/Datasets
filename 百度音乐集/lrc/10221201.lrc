[00:01.12]Steve Earle - Marie
[00:07.89]
[00:29.19]I stood in line and left my name
[00:32.23]Took about six hours or so
[00:35.89]Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
[00:39.62]Said they'd let me know
[00:41.98]
[00:43.06]I put in my time till the Pocono line
[00:45.72]Shut down two years ago
[00:49.70]I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
[00:53.01]Now I can't stay there no more
[00:56.38]
[01:02.38]Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
[01:05.51]To move some old cars around
[01:08.69]Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
[01:12.53]Van and do a little settlin' down
[01:15.33]
[01:15.63]But I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
[01:20.35]And the junkyard's a pretty good ways
[01:22.76]That job's about a half week old besides
[01:26.55]It'd be gone now anyway
[01:29.74]
[01:35.32]Unemployment said I got no more checks
[01:38.65]And they showed me to the hall
[01:41.86]My brother died in Georgia some time ago
[01:45.22]I got no one left to call
[01:48.46]
[01:49.05]Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
[01:52.57]A little short on food that's all
[01:55.74]Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
[01:59.52]We're headed down into fall
[02:02.72]
[02:08.12]I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
[02:11.71]Hustled up a little dough
[02:15.27]But I got drunk and I woke up rolled
[02:18.85]A couple of months ago
[02:21.41]
[02:21.88]They got my harp and they got my dollar
[02:25.64]Them low life so and so's
[02:29.20]Harps cost money and I ain't got it
[02:32.52]It's my own fault, I suppose
[02:35.61]
[02:41.00]The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
[02:44.65]Two freights everyday
[02:48.39]If it was just me, I'd be headed south
[02:51.28]But Marie can't catch no train
[02:54.61]
[02:55.01]She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby
[02:58.59]Says we gotta wait and see
[03:01.76]In my heart I know it's a little boy
[03:04.90]Hope he don't end up like me
[03:08.52]
[03:13.88]Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
[03:17.71]I gotta stand in line again
[03:21.39]I want to kill him but I just say no
[03:24.41]I had enough of that line my friend
[03:27.38]
[03:27.92]I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
[03:31.40]I'm feelin' too low down to lie
[03:35.12]I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
[03:38.19]Hope she don't break down and cry
[03:41.55]
[04:08.04]Marie she didn't wake up this morning
[04:12.67]She didn't even try
[04:15.40]She just rolled over and went to Heaven
[04:18.63]My little boy safe inside
[04:21.49]
[04:21.86]I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
[04:25.38]Caught a Chesapeak on the fly
[04:29.05]Marie will know I'm headed south
[04:32.31]So's to meet me by and by
[04:35.39]
[04:36.20]Marie will know I'm headed south
[04:39.18]So to meet me by and by
[04:45.65]
