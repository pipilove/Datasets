[00:00.00]When I'm Gone
[00:00.10]Eminem
[00:00.15]
[00:00.48]Yeah...
[00:02.51]It's my life...
[00:04.06]My own words I guess...
[00:06.21]Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
[00:09.46]Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
[00:12.56]When they know they're your heart
[00:14.20]And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
[00:19.02]But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
[00:22.42]And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
[00:25.43]What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
[00:28.31]"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
[00:31.62]"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
[00:35.04]I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
[00:38.05]Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
[00:41.28]I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
[00:44.31]Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
[00:47.75]And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
[00:51.01]That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
[00:54.31]Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...
[00:57.53]
[00:58.17]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[01:00.50]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[01:03.75]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[01:06.25]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[01:09.77]Just smile back
[01:11.04]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[01:13.70]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[01:16.75]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[01:19.64]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[01:22.61]Just smile back...
[01:23.42]
[01:23.65]I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
[01:26.40]She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
[01:29.01]"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
[01:32.55]Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying
[01:35.79]"You always say that, you always say this is the last time
[01:39.18]"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"
[01:42.03]She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
[01:45.48]"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"
[01:48.57]Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
[01:51.77]It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"
[01:55.53]I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
[01:58.24]These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
[02:01.54]They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight
[02:05.15]Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
[02:08.37]And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
[02:11.11]It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
[02:14.46]And I'm singing...
[02:15.25]
[02:15.47]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[02:17.52]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[02:20.52]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[02:23.15]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[02:26.47]Just smile back
[02:27.73]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[02:30.49]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[02:33.38]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[02:35.93]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[02:39.30]Just smile back...
[02:40.11]
[02:40.35]Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
[02:42.83]The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
[02:45.94]I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
[02:49.00]They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
[02:52.61]I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
[02:55.68]"Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
[02:59.12]But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
[03:02.22]"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
[03:05.59]"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
[03:08.71]"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
[03:11.67]"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
[03:14.83]"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone"
[03:18.12]But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice
[03:21.14]"Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
[03:24.67]That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
[03:28.33]It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
[03:33.05]Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
[03:37.32]I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
[03:40.52]How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
[03:43.45]I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
[03:46.97]Put it to my brain and scream "die Shady" and pump it
[03:50.18]The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
[03:55.54]That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
[04:00.55]It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk up to Kim and kiss her
[04:05.50]Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
[04:09.31]Almost as if to say..
[04:10.37]
[04:10.60]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[04:13.05]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[04:15.86]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[04:18.11]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[04:21.82]Just smile back
[04:22.89]And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
[04:25.61]Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
[04:28.49]Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
[04:31.30]And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
[04:34.65]Just smile back...
