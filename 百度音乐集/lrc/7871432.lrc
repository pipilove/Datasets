[00:12.12]
[00:16.11]Standing by the window
[00:19.60]Eyes upon the moon
[00:23.55]Hoping that the memory will leave her spirit soon
[00:29.84]
[00:30.47]She shuts the doors and lights
[00:32.02]And lays her body on the bed
[00:34.72]Where images and words are running deep
[00:39.05]She has too much pride to pull the sheets above her head
[00:43.29]So quietly she lays and waits for sleep
[00:46.01]
[00:53.88]She stares at the ceiling
[00:55.64]And tries not to think
[01:02.45]And pictures the chains
[01:04.18]She's been trying to link again
[01:07.92]But the feeling is gone
[01:10.13]
[01:10.39]And water can't cover her memory
[01:14.40]And ashes can't answer her pain
[01:18.58]God give me the power to take breath from a breeze
[01:22.78]And call life from a cold metal frame
[01:26.00]
[01:31.05]In with the ashes
[01:34.15]Or up with the smoke from the fire
[01:39.24]With wings up in heaven
[01:42.44]Or here, lying in bed
[01:47.17]Palm of her hand to my head
[01:51.45]Now and forever curled
[01:55.75]In my heart and the heart of the world
[02:01.51]
