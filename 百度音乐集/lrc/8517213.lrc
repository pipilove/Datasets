[00:12.34]Last time I though we have this talk
[00:15.91]Boy you were getting ready to leave
[00:17.93]I thought baby you have done
[00:20.46]Cause for a while you can barely look at me.
[00:23.30]This time I thought that we'd be fine
[00:27.02]That I'd forget the things that you said
[00:28.93]I tried crossing out your words
[00:31.80]But baby you can not forget the past (x2)
[00:42.35]Still baby
[00:43.50]
[00:44.00]I'm so unpredictable
[00:45.37]you don't know what to think
[00:46.83]So unemotional
[00:48.51]Wonder if I'm even still in love
[00:49.86]You see
[00:50.74]I don't know what to tell you now
[00:52.99]Is always harder the second time around
