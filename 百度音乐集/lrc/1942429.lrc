[00:07.06]James Blunt
[00:22.54]
[00:24.54]My life is brilliant.
[00:26.63]
[00:36.20]My life is brilliant.
[00:39.09]My love is pure.
[00:42.00]I saw an angel.
[00:44.85]Of that I''m sure.
[00:46.73]She smiled at me on the subway.
[00:50.05]She was with another man.
[00:53.03]But I won''t lose no sleep on that,
[00:55.93]''Cause I''ve got a plan.
[00:57.97]
[00:59.48]You''re beautiful. You''re beautiful.
[01:05.27]You''re beautiful, it''s true.
[01:10.40]I saw your face in a crowded place,
[01:17.74]And I don''t know what to do,
[01:23.25]''Cause I''ll never be with you.
[01:27.55]
[01:37.43]Yeah, she caught my eye,
[01:41.04]As we walked on by.
[01:43.90]She could see from my face that I was,
[01:47.77]Fucking high,
[01:49.48]And I don''t think that I''ll see her again,
[01:54.87]But we shared a moment that will last till the end.
[02:00.43]
[02:02.11]You''re beautiful. You''re beautiful.
[02:07.88]You''re beautiful, it''s true.
[02:13.00]I saw your face in a crowded place,
[02:20.37]And I don''t know what to do,
[02:25.86]''Cause I''ll never be with you.
[02:29.88]
[02:44.31]You''re beautiful. You''re beautiful.
[02:50.16]You''re beautiful, it''s true.
[02:55.26]There must be an angel with a smile on her face,
[03:02.54]When she thought up that I should be with you.
[03:05.28]
[03:12.48]But it''s time to face the truth,
[03:18.25]I will never be with you.
