[04:40.80][04:31.59][00:47.96]What If
[00:00.00]What if there was no life?
[00:05.96]Nothing wrong, nothing right.
[00:12.90]What if there was no time?
[00:19.83]And no reason or rhyme.
[00:27.42]What if you should decide,
[00:33.32]that you don't want me there by your side.
[00:40.36]That you don't want me there in your life.
[00:51.53]What if I got it wrong
[00:59.53]and no poem or song
[01:07.18]Could put right what I got wrong
[01:13.27]Or make you feel I belong
[01:19.27]What if you should decide
[01:25.98]that you don't want me there by your side
[01:33.46]That you don't want me there in your life.
[01:43.69]Oooh, that's right
[01:51.44]Let's take a breath jump over the side
[01:58.79]Oooh, that's right
[02:05.23]How can you know it if you don't even try
[02:12.95]Oooh, that's right
[02:19.11]Every step that you take
[02:25.97]could be your biggest mistake
[02:33.80]It could bend or it could break
[02:39.35]But that's the risk that you take
[02:46.64]What if you should decide
[02:53.48]That you don't want me there in your life
[03:00.15]That you don't want me there by your side.
[03:08.13]
[03:12.52]Oooh, that's right
[03:18.37]Let's take a breath jump over the side
[03:26.01]Oooh, that's right
[03:31.95]How can you know it when you don't even try
[03:40.12]Oooh, that's right
[03:49.63]
[03:52.07]Ohhhhh
[03:55.63]Oooh, that's right
[04:00.31]Let's take a breath jump over the side
[04:07.84]Oooh, that's right
[04:14.11]You know that darkness always turns into light
[04:21.63]Oooh, that's right
