[00:19.25]I have seen
[00:21.60]Too many sad eyes look at me
[00:27.20]And eyes that set me free
[00:31.90]All the places that I've been
[03:00.63][01:55.34][00:40.21]Thank you for
[03:05.77][02:00.48][00:44.97]The letters that you thought you wrote in vain
[03:13.10][02:07.70][00:52.33]And for
[03:15.77][02:10.32][00:55.04]The times you chose to stand out in the rain
[03:23.13][02:17.74][01:01.85]And wait
[01:09.60][01:04.70]For me
[01:14.82]Your words
[01:17.62]Your words have made us see
[01:22.53]A little honesty
[01:27.48]In a world that doesn't share
[01:34.57]And your eyes
[01:37.52]Tell the story of your pain
[01:42.05]Severity of your destiny
[01:47.57]In a world that doesn't care
[02:40.97]You
[02:43.20]You understand my pain
[02:48.07]From this I gather strength
[02:53.13]In that we are the same
[03:25.96]The life I live would never be the same
[03:33.04]Without you here
[03:40.59]You here
[03:45.52]You here
[03:49.69]Without you here
[04:07.12](End)
