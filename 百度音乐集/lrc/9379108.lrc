[00:01.56]Only Hope
[00:02.88]Mandy Moore
[00:04.23]
[00:05.92]There's a song that's inside of my soul
[00:14.46]It's the one that I've tried to write
[00:19.52]Over and over again
[00:23.90]I'm awake in the infinite cold
[00:32.50]Would you sing to me
[00:34.61]Over and over and over again?
[00:40.32]So I lay my head back down
[00:49.28]And I lift my hands and pray
[00:56.20]To be only yours
[00:59.02]I pray to be only yours
[01:03.32]I know now you're my only hope
[01:09.91]
[01:17.16]Sing to me the song of the stars
[01:26.01]Of your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again
[01:35.14]When it feels like my dreams are so far
[01:44.05]Sing to me all the plans that you have for me
[01:49.60]Over again
[01:51.95]So I lay my head back down
[02:01.14]And I lift my hands and pray
[02:08.00]To be only yours
[02:10.76]I pray to be only yours
[02:14.81]I know now you're my only hope
[02:24.75]I gave my destiny
[02:29.29]I'll give you all of me
[02:33.87]I want your symphony
[02:37.15]Singing in all that I am
[02:41.58]At the top of my lungs
[02:45.80]I'm giving it love
[02:52.03]So I lay my head back down
[02:59.76]And I lift my hands and pray
[03:07.08]To be only yours
[03:09.62]I pray to be only yours
[03:14.19]I pray to be only yours
[03:18.58]I know now you're my only hope
[03:26.40]
