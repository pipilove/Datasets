[00:09.11]纪念我的朋克岁月  教哥
[00:11.32]There's a lightning storm each and every night
[00:16.72]Crashing inside you like motorbikes
[00:22.13]We toss and turn, sleep so loud
[00:27.35]Grind the teeth in our empty mouths
[00:32.72]Our empty
[00:37.86]There's a forest fire burning bright
[00:43.29]Spreading quickly towards our last rights
[00:49.02]Nowhere to run, pointless to hide
[00:54.01]Just lay there and scream, pretending to try
[00:59.60]Pretending
[01:04.29]Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
[01:09.11]Everyone learns faster on fire
[01:14.19]Things took a turn, lost all desire
[01:19.14]You live and you burn
[01:24.52]You live and you burn
[01:36.52]This impending doom is left deep inside
[01:42.07]And it's haunting you each and every night
[01:47.53]Light starving wolves, drowning sheep
[01:52.85]We close our eyes, pretending to sleep
[01:58.17]Descending
[02:02.56]Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
[02:07.86]Everyone learns faster on fire
[02:12.87]Things took a turn, lost all desire
[02:18.14]You live and you burn
[02:24.67]You live and...
[02:26.66]Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
[02:29.93]Like hell burning silently strong
[02:35.47]Somehow we fell down by the wayside
[02:41.17]And somehow this hell is home
[02:46.26]As we burn, pretending to fight it
[02:50.54]Everyone learns faster on fire
[02:55.41]Things took a turn, lost all desire
[03:00.87]You live and you burn
[03:05.76]You live and
[03:07.82]Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
[03:12.37]Like hell burning silently strong
[03:17.94]Somehow we fell down by the wayside
[03:22.27]And somehow this hell is home
[03:28.91]Right now, this hell is my home
