[00:10.00]Duran Duran - Ordinary World
[00:28.00]Came in from a rainy Thursday
[00:32.00]on the avenue
[00:35.00]thought I heard you talking softly
[00:42.00]I turned on the lights, the TV
[00:45.00]and the radio
[00:49.00]still I can't escape the ghost of you
[00:56.00]What has happened to it all?
[00:59.00]Crazy, some'd say
[01:03.00]Where is the life that I recognize?
[01:09.00]gone away
[02:26.00][01:10.00]But I won't cry for yesterday
[02:29.00][01:14.00]there's an ordinary world
[02:32.00][01:17.00]Somehow I have to find
[02:39.00][01:24.00]and as I try to make my way
[02:43.00][01:27.00]to the ordinary world
[02:46.00][01:31.00]I will learn to survive
[01:44.00]Passion or coincidence
[01:47.00]once prompted you to say
[01:51.00]"Pride will tear us both apart"
[01:56.00]Well now pride's gone out the window
[02:00.00]cross the rooftops
[02:02.00]run away
[02:04.00]left me in the vacuum of my heart
[02:11.00]What is happening to me?
[02:14.00]Crazy, some'd say
[02:18.00]Where is my friend when I need you most?
[02:24.00]Gone away
[03:20.00]Papers in the roadside
[03:22.00]tell of suffering and greed
[03:26.00]here today, forgot tomorrow
[03:32.00]ooh, here besides the news
[03:36.00]of holy war and holy need
[03:40.00]ours is just a little sorrowed talk
[04:15.00]And I don't cry for yesterday
[04:19.00]there's an ordinary world
[04:22.00]Somehow I have to find
[04:29.00]and as I try to make my way
[04:32.00]to the ordinary world
[04:36.00]I will learn to survive
[04:41.00]every one
[04:48.00]is my world, I will learn to survive
[04:55.00]any one
[05:02.00]is my world, I will learn to survive
[05:09.00]any one
[05:15.00]is my world
[05:22.00]every one
[05:29.00]is my world
