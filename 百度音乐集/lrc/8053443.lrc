[00:43.50][03:32.50]There's a destination a little up the road
[00:46.50][03:34.50]From the habitations and the towns we know
[00:49.50][03:37.50]A place we saw the lights turn low
[00:51.50][03:40.50]The jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow
[00:54.50][03:42.50]Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
[00:56.50][03:45.50]Two turntables and a microphone
[00:59.50][03:47.50]Bottles and cans
[01:00.50][01:01.50][03:48.50][03:49.50]And just clap your hands
[01:04.50][01:09.50][01:14.50][01:18.50][01:53.50][01:58.50][02:53.50][02:58.50][03:52.50][03:57.50]Where it's at!

[01:24.50]Take me home with my elevator bones!
[01:31.50]That was a good drum break
[01:33.50]Pick yourself up off the side of the road
[01:35.50]With your elevator bones and your whip-flash tones
[01:38.50]Members only hypnotizers
[01:41.50]Move through the room like ambulance drivers
[01:43.50]Shine your shoes with your microphone blues
[01:46.50]Hirsutes with your parachuits fruits
[01:48.50]Passing the dutchie from coast to coast
[01:50.50]Let the man get Wilson; wanna rock the most now
[02:10.50]What about those who swing both ways? AC/DC's
[02:17.50]Let's make it out, baby
[02:38.50][02:40.50][02:43.50][02:45.50][02:47.50][02:50.50]Two turntables and a microphone
[02:51.50]We're all part of the total symbol
[03:08.50]Oh, dear me. Make-out City's a two-horse town
[03:13.50]That's beautiful, Dad!
