[00:00.00]Let it Be - Lennon/McCartney
[00:13.00]
[00:13.17]When I find myself in times of trouble
[00:16.87]Mother Mary comes to me
[00:19.84]Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
[00:25.91]And in my hour of darkness
[00:28.63]She is standing right in front of me
[00:32.57]Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
[02:26.51][01:31.97][00:38.43]Let it be, let it be.
[02:34.44][01:38.97][00:45.52]Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
[02:40.40][01:44.21][00:50.50]
[00:51.80]And when the broken hearted people
[00:55.41]Living in the world agree,
[00:58.56]There will be an answer, let it be.
[01:04.78]For though they may be parted there is
[01:08.71]Still a chance that they will see
[01:12.02]There will be an answer, let it be.
[01:18.03]Let it be, let it be. Yeah
[01:25.59]There will be an answer, let it be.

[02:41.61]And when the night is cloudy,
[02:44.28]There is still a light that shines on me,
[02:48.57]Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
[02:55.25]I wake up to the sound of music
[02:59.01]Mother Mary comes to me
[03:02.35]Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
[03:08.50]Let it be, let it be.
[03:16.44]There will be an answer, let it be.
[03:22.58]Let it be, let it be,
[03:30.40]Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
