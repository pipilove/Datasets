[00:28.35]I know I played my part in making it what it is
[00:32.23]And I know that you did the same
[00:34.86]I guess i'm up outta here

[00:51.55]I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away
[00:55.89]

[01:39.64]Cause my heart is what got me here
[01:42.85]So hurt from what you've done
[01:44.86]More than enough reasons for me to move on
[01:49.27]Cause I gave you my word
[01:50.64]You put your trust in me
[01:52.29]Supposed to be the one to give you what you need

[02:41.03]I knew that something was wrong babe
[02:44.56]The cops the one who had told me
[02:46.36]That you was alone inside an empty room
[02:50.54]Identified you as my baby
