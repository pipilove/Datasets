[00:13.08]歌曲:<Requiem>
[00:19.87]歌手:Three Graces
[00:21.98]
[00:32.38]As you close your eyes
[00:35.62]
[00:36.00]I'll become a dream
[00:39.51]
[00:40.09]Fading like the last star in the sky
[00:46.26]
[00:48.12]With this final kiss
[00:51.34]
[00:51.74]Stolen from your lips
[00:54.88]
[00:55.29]You must be the strong one
[01:01.26]
[01:01.66]Do what's right for you and I
[01:03.74]
[01:04.33]Oh I will sing my requiem
[01:10.12]
[01:10.55]To a love that hurts with every breath
[01:17.43]
[01:17.86]And as I walk alone
[01:22.01]
[01:22.33]And live without your love,
[01:26.19]
[01:26.50]I will sing my requiem, my requiem
[01:33.86]
[01:34.17]To you.
[01:38.21]
[01:39.25]We met just by chance
[01:42.64]
[01:43.03]Or just by mistake,
[01:46.02]
[01:46.64]The universe was playing with our lives
[01:52.82]
[01:54.74]It was all a game
[01:58.25]
[01:58.62]Until I realized you're the one
[02:03.65]
[02:04.10]I've needed all this time
[02:07.28]
[02:07.77]You saved my life
[02:09.98]
[02:10.50]Oh I will sing my requiem
[02:16.57]
[02:17.46]To a love that hurts with every breath
[02:24.53]
[02:25.10]And as I walk alone
[02:28.78]
[02:29.12]And live without your love,
[02:32.85]
[02:33.28]I will sing my requiem,
[02:36.89]
[02:37.49]my requiem To you.
[02:56.21]
[02:56.73]I see your face
[03:00.30]
[03:00.77]The rising sun
[03:04.34]
[03:04.67]And then I realize that you are gone
[03:12.73]
[03:13.39]Oh I will sing my requiem
[03:20.29]
[03:20.51]To a love that hurts with every breath
[03:27.46]
[03:27.77]And as I walk alone
[03:31.02]
[03:31.46]And live without your love,
[03:35.78]
[03:36.03]I will sing my requiem, my requiem
[03:43.66]
[03:43.98]To you.
[03:49.85]
[03:51.83]To you
[03:58.07]
