[00:01.10]
[00:02.45]She's got my heart strapped down
[00:04.40]To the beat just like an 808.
[00:06.55]Did you know I'm thinking of you every day?
[00:08.54]Is it wrong?
[00:09.30]Is it wrong?
[00:10.23]Is it wrong?
[00:11.27]Is it too loud now?
[00:12.43]Is it shaking up your bones,
[00:13.90]Yeah, from head down to your toes?
[00:16.23]Roll along.
[00:17.21]Roll along.
[00:18.32]Roll along.
[00:18.72]
[00:19.06]She's gonna move like the smoke in your lungs.,
[00:20.73]And I've been dreaming I can feel her on the tip of my tongue,
[00:22.51]And tell me how you're feeling,
[00:23.88]We could touch the ceiling.
[00:24.82]Jump-start my heart.
[00:25.86]
[00:26.53]Oh, girl,
[00:27.27]I wanna know your love.
[00:29.71]I wanna feel your warmth on my skin (so recklessly).
[00:34.75]I'll show up and be your summer love,
[00:37.68]'Cause you're the breakout feeling of my week (so endlessly).
[00:42.50]Say there's still time. Ooo
[00:49.27]
[00:49.92]Did you feel the bass stop?
[00:51.47]Drop your heart,
[00:52.40]Pick it up, yeah.
[00:54.01]I wanna see your night eyes,
[00:55.37]And if it feels right,
[00:56.31]Then maybe we can be alone.
[00:58.24]Take everything around you,
[00:59.35]Let me surround you,
[01:00.31]Is it wrong?
[01:01.08]Is it wrong?
[01:02.31]Is it wrong?
[01:02.63]Is it too late now,
[01:04.04]For me to compliment your style?
[01:05.94]You've got that subtle grace for miles.
[01:07.73]Roll along.
[01:09.11]Roll along.
[01:10.13]Roll along.
[01:10.63]
[01:11.06]She's gonna move like the smoke in your lungs.,
[01:12.55]And I've been dreaming I can feel her on the tip of my tongue,
[01:14.47]And tell me how you're feeling,
[01:15.73]We could touch the ceiling.
[01:16.58]Jump-start my heart.

[01:18.29]Oh, girl,
[01:19.70]I wanna know your love.
[01:21.59]I wanna feel your warmth on my skin (so recklessly).
[01:26.42]I'll show up and be your summer love,
[01:29.61]'Cause you're the breakout feeling of my week (so endlessly).
[01:34.54]Say there's still time. Ooo
[01:39.09]
[01:39.61]Feel your heart drop,
[01:40.51]Pick it up, yeah.
[01:42.06]And I can tell we're gonna be alone.
[01:45.76]So when the heat lacks,
[01:47.90]Bring it back,
[01:48.52]Could you be my own?
[01:50.34]'Cause the weather's getting kinda cold.
[01:54.61]
[01:55.10]She's gonna move like the smoke in your lungs.,
[01:56.39]And I've been dreaming I can feel her on the tip of my tongue,
[01:58.36]And tell me how you're feeling,
[01:59.49]We could touch the ceiling.
[02:01.25]Oh, oh.

[02:18.44]
[02:19.30]Night sky,
[02:19.85]Light up your diamond eyes,
[02:21.72]And baby, you won't feel alone
[02:24.97]I'll show up, and be your summer love,
[02:29.74]And feel the heat seep through my bones.
[02:34.08](So endlessly)
