[00:22.57]It's late in the evening
[00:27.41]she's wondering what clothes to wear.
[00:32.60]She puts on her make-up
[00:37.55]and brushes her long blonde hair.
[00:42.81]And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
[00:51.01]And I say, Yes, you look wonderful tonight.
[00:58.30]
[01:08.18]We go to a party and everyone turns to see
[01:18.27]This beautiful lady that's walking around with me.
[01:28.66]And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
[01:36.81]And I say, Yes, I feel wonderful tonight.
[01:44.30]
[01:46.35]I feel wonderful because I see
[01:52.38]The love light in your eyes.
[01:57.07]And the wonder of it all
[02:02.08]Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.
[02:10.98]
[02:29.43]It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head,
[02:39.13]So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed.
[02:49.25]And then I tell her, as I turn out the light,
[02:57.94]I say, My darling, you were wonderful tonight.
[03:08.57]Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight.
