[00:59.04]I will shape myself into your pocket
[01:02.57]Invisible, do what you want, do what you want
[01:13.91]I will sink and I will disappear
[01:17.53]I will slip into the groove and cut me up, and cut me up
[01:28.25].
[01:31.92]There's an empty space inside my heart
[01:35.52]Where the weeds take root
[01:37.82]And now I'll set you free
[01:42.10]I'll set you free
[01:46.57]There's an empty space inside my heart
[01:50.62]Where the weeds take root
[01:52.48]Tonight I'll set you free
[01:57.02]I'll set you free
[01:59.77].
[02:02.48].
[02:03.97]Slowly we unfurl
[02:07.61]As lotus flowers
[02:09.76]'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
[02:15.26]Just to see what if
[02:19.02]Just to see what is
[02:22.57]I can't kick your habit
[02:24.78]Just to feed your fast ballooning head
[02:30.05]Listen to your heart
[02:34.81].
[02:37.63].
[02:41.33].
[02:44.90].
[02:47.86]We will sink and be quiet as mice
[02:51.21]While the cat is away; do what we want
[02:56.82]Do what we want
[03:01.30].
[03:03.77].
[03:05.69]There's an empty space inside my heart
[03:09.47]Where the weeds take root
[03:11.25]So now I set you free
[03:15.61]I set you free
[03:18.81].
[03:22.60].
[03:28.39]'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
[03:34.10]Just to see what if
[03:37.61]Just to see what is
[03:41.34].
[03:43.59]Put the lotus flower into my room
[03:48.31].
[03:52.77]Slowly we unfurl
[03:56.42]As lotus flowers
[03:58.52]'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
[04:03.85]I dance around a pit
[04:07.51]The darkness is beneath
[04:11.34]I can't kick your habit
[04:13.27]Just to feed your fast ballooning head
[04:18.90]Listen to your heart
[04:26.88].
[04:35.66].
[04:43.21].
