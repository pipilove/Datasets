[00:04.39]Dozens of girls would storm up;
[00:08.32]I had to lock my door,
[00:11.83]Somehow I couldn't warm up
[00:15.47]To one before.
[00:19.77]What was it that controlled me?
[00:23.95]What kept my lovelife lean?
[00:27.52]My intuition told me
[00:30.92]You'd come on the scene.
[00:35.88]Lady, listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat,
[00:41.17]And you'll get just what I mean.
[00:46.79]
[00:51.05]Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
[00:59.73]Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!
[01:07.72]Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me;
[01:16.44]You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me!
[01:25.75]I love all the many charms about you!
[01:34.50]Above all I want these arms about you.
[01:43.16]Don't be a naughty baby,
[01:46.98]Come to daddy, come to daddy, do!
[01:51.82]My sweet embraceable you!

[02:18.08]Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me;
[02:26.34]You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me!
[02:35.58]I love all the many charms about you!
[02:44.37]Above all I want these arms about you.
[02:52.89]Now don't be a naughty baby,
[02:56.89]Come to daddy, come to daddy, do!
[03:01.75]My sweet embraceable you!
