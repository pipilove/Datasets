[00:14.80]Would have given up my life for you
[00:21.40]Guess it's true what they say about love
[00:25.55]It's blind
[00:28.40]Girl, you lied straight to my face
[00:32.30]Looking in my eyes
[00:35.25]And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
[00:41.40]And all you had to do
[00:44.80]Was apologize
[00:49.40]
[00:50.85]You didn't say you're sorry
[00:55.10]I don't understand
[00:57.75]You don't care that you hurt me
[01:02.00]And now I'm half the man
[01:05.50]That I used to be when it was you and me
[01:08.90]You didn't love me enough
[01:12.70]My heart may never mend
[01:15.90]And you'll never get to love me, again
[01:27.90]
[01:29.30]No, no, no, no, no, no
[01:36.30]
[01:37.60]Sadness has me at the end of the line
[01:44.60]Helpless watched you break this heart of mine
[01:51.20]And loneliness only wants you back here with me
[01:58.10]Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me
[02:04.60]And all you had to do
[02:07.90]Was apologize, and mean it
[02:13.75]But you didn't say you're sorry
[02:18.30]I don't understand
[02:21.10]You don't care that you hurt me
[02:25.25]And now I'm half the man
[02:28.40]That I used to be when it was you and me
[02:32.20]You didn't love me enough
[02:35.60]My heart may never mend
[02:38.80]And you'll never get to love me
[02:44.90]
[02:45.60]It's like hell I could go back in time
[02:52.00]Maybe then I could see how
[02:58.70]Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try
[03:04.80]But it's too late, it's over now
[03:10.90]
[03:21.50]You didn't say you're sorry
[03:25.80]I don't understand
[03:28.50]You don't care that you hurt me
[03:32.75]And now I'm half the man
[03:36.15]That I used to be when it was you and me
[03:39.80]You didn't love me enough
[03:48.40]My heart may never mend
[03:52.00]And you'll never get to love me
[03:58.00]Again
[04:03.65]
[04:05.25]Again, yeah, yeah
[04:12.45]Again, again, again, yeah, yeah, yeah
[04:18.00]Never get to love me
