[00:06.59]I'm on 'til I'm on a island
[00:07.76]My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
[00:10.49]Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all wit' kindness
[00:13.27]I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
[00:16.53]You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
[00:18.70]Slap up a cop and then snatch 'im out of his uniform
[00:21.52]Leave him wit' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
[00:24.26]And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
[00:27.01]Y'allintellect mad slow, y'all fags know
[00:29.66]Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
[00:31.35]Bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole
[00:34.36]Me and Shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
[00:38.53]I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
[00:40.74]Though I ain't wrapped tight
[00:42.40]My blood type's the '80s!
[00:43.90]My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys
[00:46.50]You still fly kites daily!
[00:48.37]Catch me in my Mercedes
[00:49.53]Bumpin' "Ice, Ice Baby," screamin' Shady 'til I die
[00:52.15]Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
[00:54.07]So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
[00:56.63]And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
[00:59.49]Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Damn)
[01:02.53]Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
[01:05.37]And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
[01:07.98]Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick (My penis in your anus!)
[01:11.18]You morons think that I'm a genius
[01:12.77]Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
[01:15.69]Crazy, I am back, and I am razor sharp, baby
[01:19.35]And that's back wit' a capital B wit' an exclamation mark, maybe
[01:21.70]You should listen when I flip the linguistics
[01:23.84]'Cause I'm'onna rip this mystical slick shit
[01:24.91]You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
[01:27.23]'Cause after I spit the bullets, I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
[01:30.85]I'ma kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'ma live this
[01:33.46]Livin' life in the fast lane
[01:34.81]Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
[01:37.86]Only got a gallon in the gas tank
[01:40.16]But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
[01:43.62]I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
[01:46.42]Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
[01:49.65]I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
[01:52.17]I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
[01:55.31]My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
[01:57.59]At war wit' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
[02:00.66]My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
[02:03.82]I made a pact with the Devil that says "I'll let you take me
[02:06.37]You let me take this shovel, dig up the corspes, Jack Kevorkian"
[02:09.01]Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
[02:11.85]I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
[02:13.72]My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
[02:15.83]Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity
[02:18.07]Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
[02:20.26]Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out
[02:21.37]Girl, giddy up, now get, get down
[02:22.66]He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now
[02:25.41]Here, little t t trailer trash, take a look who's back in t t town
[02:28.19]Did I s st stutter, motherfucker? Fuck them all, he's just
[02:30.61]A whole motherfuckin' Walmart dddown every time arrround
[02:33.47]And he came to the club tonight wit' 5'9″ to hold this bitch down
[02:36.58]Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d dr drown
[02:39.36]Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated
[02:41.46]Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
[02:44.25]To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
[02:48.00]Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it
[02:50.24]
[02:50.47]And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
