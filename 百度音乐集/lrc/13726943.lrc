[00:01.00]Let's get out of this town, baby we're on fire
[00:07.80]Everyone around here wants to be going down, down
[00:14.97]If you stick with me, I can take you higher, and higher
[00:21.81]It feels like all of our friends are lost
[00:24.32]Nobody's found, found, found
[00:27.45]
[00:29.04]I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
[00:35.74]You came along scooped me up like a baby
[00:41.91]
[00:43.91]Every now and then, the stars align
[00:47.33]Boy and girl meet by the great design
[00:50.77]Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
[00:56.16]
[00:58.10]Everybody told me love was blind
[01:01.46]Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
[01:05.04]Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time
[01:11.82]
[01:15.49]Bugging into my car, got a bad desire
[01:22.24]You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
[01:29.62]You're a crazy con and you're a crazy liar
[01:33.97]But baby, nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down
[01:41.96]
[01:43.70]I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
[01:50.30]You taught me that it was good to be crazy
[01:56.32]
[01:58.56]Every now and then, the stars align
[02:01.93]Boy and girl meet by the great design
[02:05.48]Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
[02:10.74]
[02:12.78]Everybody told me love was blind
[02:16.13]Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
[02:19.66]Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time
[02:26.51]
[02:29.37]Feels like, feels like, you know, it feels like
[02:34.48]Falling in love for the first time
[02:36.81]Feels like, you know, it feels like
[02:39.75]Falling in love
[02:41.58]
[02:44.80]Every now and then, the stars align
