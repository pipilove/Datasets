[00:47.72]Sittin' over here
[00:48.77]Starin' in your face
[00:49.85]With lust in my eyes
[00:50.96]Sure don't give a damn and
[00:52.35]Ya don't know
[00:53.26]That I've been dreamin' of ya in my fantasy
[00:54.91]Never once you looked at me,
[00:59.01]Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you
[01:00.06]To fulfill my needs
[01:01.10]Think what you want
[01:03.91]Let your mind free
[01:04.52]Run free to a place that no one dares to
[01:06.09]How many nights I've laid in bed exited over you
[01:07.93]I've closed my eyes and thought of us,
[01:10.53]A hundred different ways
[01:12.48]I've gotten there so many times
[01:15.33]I wonder how 'bout you
[01:17.57]Day and night, night and day
[01:19.37]All I've got to say is
[01:24.29]If I was your girl
[01:25.63]Oh the things I'll do to you
[01:28.57]I'd make you call out my name
[01:30.17]I'd ask who it belongs to
[01:31.61]If I was your women,
[01:33.63]The things I'd do to you
[01:35.15]But I'm not, so I can't,
[01:39.35]Then I won't
[01:40.24]But, if I was your girl
[01:46.59]Allow me some time to play with your mind
[01:48.78]And you'll get there again and again
[01:51.05]Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
[01:53.48]Take your time, we've got all night
[01:55.91]You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
[01:57.58]And let me know what you like
[02:00.49]If you like, I'll go down
[02:02.92]Da down down down da down down
[02:09.87]I'll hold you in my hand and baby
[02:10.64]Your smooth and shiny feels so good against my lips, sugar
[02:11.65]I want you so bad I can taste your love
[02:12.63]Right now, baby
[02:13.39]Day and night, night and day
[02:15.18]All I've got to say is
