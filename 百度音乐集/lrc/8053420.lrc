[00:08.76]{Dr. Dre}
[00:14.38]Y'all know me, still the same O.G., but I been low key
[00:17.45]Hated on by most these niggaz wit no cheese, no deals and no G's
[00:20.44]No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles, and no ski's
[00:24.96]Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries
[00:28.78]Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall full of plaques
[00:33.29]Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
[00:36.09]Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?Hoe please
[00:38.59]You better bow down on both knees
[00:40.54]Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
[00:42.27]Who you think brought you the oldies?
[00:44.05]Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C's
[00:46.76]The Snoop D-O-double-G's and the group that said mother-"Fuck Tha Police"
[00:50.27]Gave you a tape full of dope beats to bump when you stroll through in your hood
[00:53.64]And when your album sales wasn't doin too good who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
[00:57.35]Y'all better listen up closely
[00:59.23]All you niggaz that said that I turned pop, or The Firm flopped
[01:01.98]Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep
[01:04.57]So FUCK Y'ALL, all of y'all; if y'all don't like me, BLOW ME!

[01:11.95]Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say
[01:14.61]But nothin comes out when they move their lips; just a bunch of gibberish
[01:17.23]And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[01:27.80]Or anyone tryin to bring trouble your way?
[01:29.71]Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (YUP)
[01:31.44]Then just study a tape of N.W.A.!
[01:33.34]One day I was walkin by, wit a Walkman on, when I caught a guy give me an awkward eye (What you lookin at?)
[01:38.23]And strangled him off in the parkin lot, wit his Karl Kani
[01:40.35]I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
[01:42.22]I'm harder than me tryin to park a Dodge when I'm drunk as fuck
[01:45.01]Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage {CRUNCH}
[01:47.71]Hoppin out wit two broken legs, tryin to walk it off
[01:50.46]"Fuck you too bitch, call the cops!"
[01:52.19]I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
[01:54.91]And when the cops came through me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
[01:58.33]Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
[02:00.75]And still weren't found out (RIGHT HERE)
[02:02.08]From here on out it's the Chronic 2
[02:04.14]Startin today and tomorrow's the new
[02:05.71]And I'm still loco enough
[02:07.20]To choke you to death wit a Charleston Chew
[02:08.48]Slim shady - hotter then a set of twin babiesin a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up when the temp goes up to the mid 80's
[02:16.26]Callin men ladies; sorry Doc but I been crazy
[02:19.56]There's no way that you can save me
[02:21.36]It's okay, go with him Hailey (Da-da?)
