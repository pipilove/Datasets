[al:X & Y]

[00:07.73]X & Y
[00:14.55]The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
[00:21.47]That and this
[00:27.57]We're part of a bigger plan
[00:33.15]Don't know what it is
[00:33.83]Don't know what it is
[00:47.23]
[00:49.51]You and me
[00:55.93]The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
[01:02.96]365 Degrees
[01:07.22]I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece
[01:10.55]Hang on a minute, just a minute please
[01:13.80]I'll come
[01:15.61]And everything under the sun
[01:17.37]And everything under the sun
[01:23.78]
[01:31.74]Chorus:
[01:32.70]What is this feeling that I can't explain
[01:34.95]And why am I never gonna sleep again
[01:38.26]What is this thing I've never seen before
[01:41.78]A little boy lost in a breaking storm
[01:45.04]
[01:45.96]Hide and sob, and away they fly
[01:48.63]To write your name in the summer sky
[01:52.08]Life has really only just begun
[01:55.74]Life that comes
[01:58.01]And everything under the sun
[02:00.77]
[02:13.51]X is Y
[02:19.85]The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
[02:26.05]365 Degrees
[02:31.03]All of the surface and the underneath
[02:34.86]Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
[02:39.86]And everything under the sun
[02:46.95]And everything under the sun
[02:49.87]
[02:55.52]What is this feeling that I can't explain
[02:59.02]And why am I never gonna sleep again
[03:02.99]What is this thing I've never seen before
[03:06.03]A little boy lost in a breaking storm
[03:09.49]
[03:10.50]Hide and sob, and away they fly
[03:13.07]To write your name in the summer sky
[03:17.02]Life has really only just begun
[03:20.10]Life that comes
[03:21.88]And everything under the sun
[03:24.77]
[03:37.79]And you don't know that you've been born
[03:45.36]Can't see the calm until the storm
[03:50.07]Can't tell your right side from your wrong
[03:56.93]Can't see the wave you're riding on
