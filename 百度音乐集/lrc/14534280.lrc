歌名-on my shoulder
歌手-the do
专辑-mouthful
Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders ?
Why do I always help you carry your boulders ?
You wonder why I carry such a weight on my shoulders
And why would I tttts such a load
Cos someday you'll see
Next time I'll try it another way
Why would you try to make me friends with them soldiers ?
When you know that I've never been familiar with orders
When you know that my heart is in a pretty disorder
And you should know that in my heart you fill every corner
And someday you'll see that all I want is to please
Next time I'll try it another way
How long will I sit and wait like a soldier ?
How many summers will it take ?
How many summers will I wait ?
How many shoulders will I break ?
Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders ?
Why am I always by your side when you're down ?
Why did I help you build a beautiful house ?
And why did I break my back for you in the cold ?
Cos someday you'll see
Next time I'll try it another way
Why would I have to quit if time makes me older ?
Why do they wonder why I never get bored ?
How could I tell them that I'll never let go
But hey, you're my man but they just won't understand
And someday you'll see that all I want is to please
Next time I'll try it another way
How long will I sit and wait like a soldier ?
How many summers will it take ?
How many summers will I wait ?
How many shoulders will I break ?
Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders ?
Why do I always help you carry your boulders ?
You wonder why I carry such a weight on my shoulders
And why would I tttts such a load
And someday you'll see that all I want is to please
Next time I'll try it another way
How long will I sit and wait like a soldier ?
How many summers will it take ?
How many summers will I wait ?
How many summers will I wait ?
