[00:00.00]Coldplay - Warning Sign
[00:21.00]
[00:42.00]A warning sign
[00:45.99]I missed the good part, then I realised
[00:52.67]I started looking and the bubble burst
[00:59.30]I started looking for excuses
[01:03.92]
[02:47.36][01:08.76]Come on in
[02:51.48][01:12.87]I've gotta tell you what I state I'm in
[02:58.29][01:19.78]I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
[03:04.96][01:26.42]That I started looking for a warning sign
[03:11.37][01:31.59]
[03:17.44][01:38.77]When the truth is I miss you
[03:30.92][01:52.39]Yeah the truth is that I miss you so
[02:04.64]
[02:20.10]A warning sign
[02:24.31]You came back to haunt me and I realised
[02:30.86]That you were an island and I passed you by
[02:37.69]You were an island to discover
[02:42.46]
[03:44.74]And I'm tired
[03:51.06]I should not have let you go
[03:57.50]
[04:28.30]So I crawl back into your open arms
[04:41.58]Yes I crawl back into your open arms
[04:55.35]And I crawl back into your open arms
[05:08.87]Yes I crawl back into your open arms
