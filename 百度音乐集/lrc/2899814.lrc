[00:08.72]送给璐璐
[00:17.65]
[00:18.74]成长常常是意味着做自己不愿意做的事情
[00:23.42]
[00:27.01]嗯，愿你能变得更加坚强
[00:34.29]
[00:34.62]We were going through the harbor going faster than the wind
[00:38.52]A perfect match between the man and the machine
[00:43.28]Underneath the surface, love's as cold and blue
[00:47.36]And you're saying this town is not made for you
[00:50.34]
[00:51.53]Starts getting closer, going through the night
[00:55.61]No one can reach us when we're out of sight
[00:59.71]Time's running faster, please let us through
[01:03.81]Going in any direction will do
[01:07.61]And you said to me,
[01:08.67]you said what it was all about and I said no
[01:12.51]
[01:28.00]You wouldn't take no for an answer
[01:30.31]Saying colder than the wind
[01:32.48]Your lack of tears is the perfect tent
[01:36.63]Don't you try to say it 'cause no words will do
[01:40.12]We were communicating through the stereo
[01:44.15]
[01:44.84]Starts getting closer, going through the night
[01:49.01]No one can reach us, no we're out of sight
[01:53.09]Time's running faster, please let us through
[01:57.17]Going in any direction will do
[02:01.21]And you said to me,
[02:01.97]you said what it was all about and I said no
[02:06.86]
[02:21.79]Out on the coast where lovers sin
[02:25.83]I wait for ships that won't come in
[02:29.94]Love is the most that I can bear
[02:34.03]I was the fact you made it clear
[02:38.10]
[02:40.26]Come out tonight;
[02:41.65]my halo's near,
[02:43.77]the coast is clear
[02:45.93]
[02:47.88]I'm out of time,
[02:50.11]speed out of sight,
[02:52.00]don't leave me here
[02:54.78]Tides don't last forever,
[02:57.68]don't you know?
