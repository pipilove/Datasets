[00:01.89]Priscilla Aha-Dream
[00:06.89]I was a little girl alone in my little world
[00:13.28]who dreamed of a little home for me.
[00:19.76]I played pretend between the trees,
[00:23.19]and fed my houseguests bark and leaves,
[00:26.40]and laughed in my pretty bed of green.
[00:32.13]I had a dream
[00:35.46]That I could fly from the highest swing.
[00:42.07]I had a dream.
[00:44.95]
[00:52.82]Long walks in the dark through woods grown behind the park,
[00:59.02]I asked God who I'm supposed to be.
[01:05.74]The stars smiled down on me,
[01:09.02]God answered in silent reverie.
[01:12.36]I said a prayer and fell asleep.
[01:18.12]I had a dream
[01:21.32]That I could fly from the highest tree.
[01:28.11]I had a dream.
[01:30.98]
[01:33.34]oh~
[02:28.70]Now I'm old and feeling grey.
[02:31.58]I don't know what's left to say about this life
[02:37.18]I'm willing to leave.
[02:40.53]I lived it full and I lived it well,
[02:44.70]there's many tales I've lived to tell.
[02:47.76]I'm ready now, I'm ready now,
[02:53.40]I'm ready now to fly from the highest wing.
[03:06.81]I had a dream.
